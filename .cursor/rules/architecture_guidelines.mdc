- New features should follow the layered architecture: UI Layer (Widgets) -> State Management (Cubits) -> Data Layer (Repositories) -> Data Sources (Firebase).
- Cubits are preferred for state management.
- Repositories must have an abstract interface in `features/<feature_name>/domain/repositories/` and an implementation in `features/<feature_name>/data/repositories/`.
- All UI measurements must use predefined constants from `core/constants/sizes.dart` (e.g., `KSizes.padding8`). Do not use hard-coded numeric values for layout.
- File and directory names use snake_case. Class names use PascalCase.
- Refer to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full details.
