- All Cubits must have unit tests using `bloc_test`.
- Repository implementations must have unit tests, mocking external dependencies (e.g., Firebase).
- Significant widgets and screens should have widget tests.
- Test files must end with `_test.dart` and mirror the source code structure within the `test/` directory.
- When writing tests, ensure proper mocking of dependencies.

Refer to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (section on Testing Guidelines) for comprehensive testing requirements and conventions.
