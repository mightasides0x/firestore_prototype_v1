When creating a new Cubit, ensure it:
1. Extends `Cubit<YourStateName>`.
2. Has an initial state in its constructor.
3. Interacts with repositories passed via its constructor (dependency injection).
4. State classes associated with the Cubit should be immutable and ideally have a `copyWith` method for generating new state instances.

Refer to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (section on State Management) and existing Cubits in the project for detailed examples.
